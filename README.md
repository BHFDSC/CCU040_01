## Project description

People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are more likely to be admitted to hospital, and more likely to die, after getting infected with COVID-19. We have recently used data from Greater Manchester (GM) to discover why this might be. We found several things that increased the risk of poor outcomes, such as age, being male, being socially deprived, ethnicity, certain medications and certain health conditions.

We will now try to repeat these results using the national COVID-IMPACT data. Studies such as this (a replication study) where people attempt to reproduce results from other studies are important. If the results are the same, then it strengthens the findings. If different then that is important as well as it shows the initial results might not be as generalisable as previously thought and may be related to factors that may not have been considered in some of the studies. This work will also help us to understand the role of regional and national datasets and how they might be best suited to different research questions.

We also plan to extend the analysis to take advantage of any extra data that is available nationally, but that was not available in GM.
